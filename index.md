## Research

My main research interest is in applied decision and data sciences. I am fascinated by the power of data-driven decision-making and motivated to leverage this power to address business, societal, and environmental challenges. I have collaborated with several companies through research work and consulting to solve business problems in operations management using tools from the fields of artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, the wisdom of crowds, and mathematical optimization. My work has been published in the European Journal of Operational Research, Decision Support Systems, Information Systems Frontier, Decision Analysis, Transportation Science, the International Conference on Information Systems, and the Americas Conference on Information Systems.
